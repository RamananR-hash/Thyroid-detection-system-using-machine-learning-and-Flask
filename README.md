This application implements the developed machine learning model to receive real time input, and then predict the outcome, indicating the level of hypothyroid .



Thyroid disorder is a prevalent health issue that can lead to various health problems. Recent studies have revealed that around 42 million people in India are affected by thyroid dysfunction or disorder. The thyroid hormone is responsible for causing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism problems. To diagnose the behaviour of the thyroid hormone, thyroid tests were performed, which includes significant components such as TSH, T3, FT4, T4, and FTI. However, manually analysing these parameters on large databases to diagnose and predict hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can be laborious. This article discusses various machine learning-based techniques, such as decision tree, random forest, naive bayes, xgboost, SVM and KNN which were applied to build predictive models. The decision tree and random forest models offer better results with the highest accuracy of 99.1166% and 99.47%, respectively, with least error rates. A comparison among the presented classifiers and the proposed model with previous works indicates better accuracy than other related works. Also, hyperparameter tuning techniques such as randomized search, Bayesian search and Grid search were used to improve accuracy of the classifier models. This study also includes the usage of raspberry pi OS and its real time application of developed machine learning model. This study can be useful for researchers to identify a suitable model for hypothyroidism detection and classification
